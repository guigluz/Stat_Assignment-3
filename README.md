# Stat_Assignment-3

## Web Scraping task

Using web scraping tools in R language, I gathered data from VivaReal (a real estate website - https://www.vivareal.com.br) about properties available for renting in the neighborhood of Bela Vista, SÃ£o Paulo - SP. Then, I created two vizualizations of such data:

* **dist_m2** shows the distribution of size in $m^{2}$, according to the type of property
* **dist_preco** shows the distribution of prices (R$ per $m^{2}$), for all residential apartments
